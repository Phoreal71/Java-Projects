<h2>Programming Project 1</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, February 23 at 11:59pm</h3>


<p><em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Read the 
<strong>Do's and Dont's</strong>
in the <strong>Course Honor Policy</strong> found on the Canvas Pages. </em>
</p>

<h3>I. Overview</h3>

<p>The theme of this assignment is to write code for a business entity to create, award, and pay contracts.
The purpose is to give you practice writing classes, fields, methods, conditional statements, and
constructors.  You will also be introduced to polymorphism.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II. Code Readability (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, getting a program to work was the only goal of programming.  That was
before computers took over the world.  Now, with highly complex software running much of our lives,
the industry has learned that computer code is a written document that must be able to communicate
to other humans what the code is doing.  If the program is too hard for a human to quickly understand,
the company does not want it.</p> 

<p>Most companies enforce readable code by having very strict rules about how the program should look.
This class will do the same, but will not be quite as strict so you can have some freedom for developing
your own style.</p>

<p><strong>To receive the full readability marks, your code must follow the following guideline:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All variables (fields, parameters, local variables) must be given appropriate and descriptive names.</li>
<li>All variable and method names must start with a lowercase letter.  All class names must start with an uppercase letter.</li>
<li>The class body should be organized so that all the fields are at the top of the file, the 
constructors are next, and then the rest of the methods.</li>
<li>Every statement of the program should be on it's own line and not sharing a line with another statement.</li>
<li>All code must be properly indented (see Appendix F of the Lewis book for an example of good style).
    The amount of indentation is up to you, but it should be at least 2 spaces, and it must be used
    consistently throughout the code.</li>
<li>You must be consistent in your use of {, }.  The closing } must be on its own line and indented
the same amount as the line containing the opening {.</li>
<li>There must be an empty line between each method.</li>
<li>There must be a space separating each operator from its operands as well as a space after each comma.</li>
<li>There must be a comment at the top of the file that includes both your name and a description of what the class represents.</li>
<li>There must be a comment directly above each method that, in one or two lines, states <em>what</em>
task the method is doing, not how it is doing it.  Do not directly copy the homework instructions.</li>
<li>There must be a comment directly above each field that, in one line, states what the field is storing.</li>
<li>There must be a comment either above or to the right of each non-field variable indicating what the variable is storing.  Any comments placed to the right should be aligned so they start on the same column.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>III. Program Testing Document (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, companies thought errors in code were only a minor inconvenience.
That was before software glitches started killing people and destroying companies.
Now, standard practice is that all code must be thoroughly verified before a company is willing to release it.
At a large number of firms, programmers are required to <em>first</em> design the test cases the 
program must pass and <em>then</em> start writing the code.  We will not be that strict in this 
class, but you will need to test your code.</p>

<p><strong>To receive full testing marks, you must write a testing report that shows that you thoroughly
tested every method of the program.</strong>  The report should be a short English description for each
test (what you are testing and what the expected result of the test is) followd by the 
actual result of the test.  If you are using DrJava, you can enter the test into the interactions pane
and then copy and paste the test code plus the result to your report.  If you fail to complete
the program, your report should indicate how you would go about testing the incomplete methods.</p>

<p><strong>Your grade on the testing report is how thoroughly you test your code, not how correctly
your code runs.</strong>  If your code is not 100% correct then your report <em>should</em> show
an incorrect result to some test.  Testing methods that do not have conditional statements should
be pretty straightforward, but you need to put thought into testing methods with conditional
statements so that each branch of the if-statement is tested.</p>

<p><em>Hint 1</em>: You can test multiple methods with one test.  For example, you can test 
each setter/getter method pair together or you can test constructors and getter methods together.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hint 2: Do not put off testing to the end!</em></strong>  Test each method after you complete it.
Many methods depend on other methods.  Delaying testing could mean cascading errors that cause your
whole project to collapse.  Since you need to test anyway, copy the tests you do into a document, and
you are most of the way to completing your report.</p>

<p>If you are not using DrJava, you are allowed (but not required) create a separate class that tests your program.
You must still write a testing report that documents the tests you do in this class.  Do not
place testing code into a main method of the classes below.  That is not the purpose
of a main method.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV. Java Programming (60% of your grade)</h3>

<p><strong>Guidelines for the program</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Unless specifically indicated, the listed methods must be public instance methods.</li>
<li>You will need to create several instance fields to store data, and every field must be private.</li>
<li>All fields must be initialized to an appropriate value.  They can be initialized either as part
if the field declaration or in the constructor.  Even if you feel that the default value provided by Java
is appropriate, you still must give an explicit initialization.</li>
<li>Any method whose name begins with <tt>set</tt> should only assign a value to an appropriately
named field.  The method should do no other processing.  Any processing described in a <tt>set</tt>
method description below is for information only.  That actual processing will be done by other methods.
</li>
<li>Any method whose name begins with <tt>get</tt> should only return the appropriate value.
No other processing should occur in these methods.</li>
<li>Your class must include only the methods listed.  You may not write any other methods.</li>
<li>The behavior of your methods must match the descriptions below.</li>
<li>You should not write any loops in your program (though loops are allowed in the testing code).</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p><strong>The program:</strong> Create the following classes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Contractor class.<br />  The Contractor class represents a contractor.  The contractor will have a name, an address, a contact person, and a balance.
The Contractor class will have the following methods:
<ol type = "a">
<li><tt>getName</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>String</tt>. Returns the name of the contractor.</li>
<li><tt>setName</tt><br /> Takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns nothing.  Sets the name of the contractor.</li>
<li><tt>getAddress</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>String</tt>. Returns the address of the contractor.</li>
<li><tt>setAddress</tt><br /> Takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns nothing. Sets the address of the contractor.</li>
<li><tt>getContact</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>String</tt>.  Returns the name of the contact person at the contractor.</li>
<li><tt>setContact</tt><br /> Takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns nothing. Sets the name of the contact person at the contractor.</li>
<li><tt>getAmountPaid</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>double</tt>.  Returns the total amount that has been paid to the contractor.</li>
<li><tt>pay</tt><br /> Takes a <tt>double</tt> and returns nothing.  Pays the contractor the specified amount.  This amount should be added to the amount already paid to the contractor.</li>
<li><tt>toString</tt>:<br /> you are to <em>override</em> the <tt>toString</tt> method inherited from <tt>Object</tt> so that
 the value returned is of the form <tt>"<em>name</em>: <em>address</em>"</tt></li>
</ol></p><p>
The Contractor class should have the following constructor:
<ol type = "a">
<li>takes a <em>name</em>, <em>address</em> and <em>contact</em> as input and sets the fields of the class appropriately.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</li>

<li><p>The GovernmentContractor class.<br />  The GovernmentContractor <em>is-a</em> Contractor that is allowed to bid on 
government contracts as well as normal contracts.  The GovernmentContractor class will have the same methods and behaviors
as the Contractor class <em>except</em> the <tt>toString</tt> method should append <tt>": approved government contractor"</tt> to the end of the string returned.</p></li>

<li><p>The Date class.<br />  The Date class will represent a date.  (Java has both Date and Calendar in the API, but both are more complex than needed for this homework.)  Our Date class will consist of three <tt>int</tt> values that represent the day, month,
and year.  The values for a Date instance will not change once they are set by the constructor.
The Date class should have the following methods:
<ol type = "a">
<li><tt>getDay</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns an <tt>int</tt>. Returns the day of the date.  The day should be a value between 1 and 31.</li>
<li><tt>getMonth</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns an <tt>int</tt>. Returns the month of the date.  The month should be between 1 and 12.</li>
<li><tt>getYear</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns an <tt>int</tt>. Returns the year of the date.</li>
<li><tt>toString</tt><br /> you are to <em>override</em> the <tt>toString</tt> method inherited from <tt>Object</tt> so that
the value returned is in the form "<em>month</em>/<em>day</em>/<em>year</em>".</li>
<li><tt>equals</tt><br /> you are to <em>override</em> the <tt>equals</tt> method inherited from <tt>Object</tt> so that
this date is equal to the input object if that object is a <tt>Date</tt> with the same day, month and year as this date.</li>
<li><tt>daysFromJan1</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns an <tt>int</tt>. Returns the number of days between this Date and January 1 of the same year.  <em>Do not write a loop to compute this</em>.  Instead use
 a large <tt>if</tt> statement based on the month of the Date.  You may assume there are no leap years.</li>
<li><tt>difference</tt><br /> A <em>class</em> method that takes two <tt>Date</tt>s as input and returns a <tt>int</tt>.  The value returned is the difference in days between them.  If the first <tt>Date</tt> input comes after the second <tt>Date</tt>, the 
difference should be positive.  If the first <tt>Date</tt> input comes before the second <tt>Date</tt>, the difference should be negative.  You may ignore leap years in computing the difference.
<em>Do not use a loop to do this.</em> Instead figure out a formula that you can use to calculate the difference.</li>
</ol></p><p>
The Date class should have one constructor:
<ol type = "a">
<li>Takes a three <tt>int</tt> values that represent the <em>month</em>, <em>day</em> and <em>year</em>, and initializes the <tt>Date</tt> instance with the given inputs.  You may assume that the inputs are all valid values.</li>
</ol>
</p></li>

<li><p>The Bid class.<br />  The Bid class will represent a bid that a contractor makes for a contract.  The bid will have the contract, the contractor, and a value.  These values will not change once set by the constructor for the class.
The Bid class will have the following methods:
<ol type = "a">
<li><tt>getContract</tt><br />Takes no input and returns a <tt>Contract</tt>. Returns the contract for the bid.</li>
<li><tt>getContractor</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>Contractor</tt>. Returns the contractor for the bid.</li>
<li><tt>getValue</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>double</tt>. Returns the value of the bid.</li>
</ol></p><p>
The Bid class will have the following constructor:
<ol type = "a">
<li>Takes a <tt>Contract</tt>, a <tt>Contractor</tt> and a <tt>double</tt> that represents the value and initializes
the Bid object appropriately.</li>
</ol>
</p></li>

<li><p>The Contract class.<br />  The Contract class represents a contract.  The contract will have an identifying number, a minimum and a maximum value (sets the range of what the contractor gets paid upon completion), a 
deadline (when the contract needs to be completed), a possible bonus and penalty paid if the contractor completes early or late, an indicator for whether the contract is accepting bids, what the best bid is so far,
and an indicator of whether the contract has been completed.
The Contract class should have the following methods:
<ol type = "a">
<li><tt>getID</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>String</tt>. Gets the ID of the contract.</li>
<li><tt>getMinValue</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>double</tt>.  Gets the minimum value of the contract.</li>
<li><tt>setMinValue</tt><br /> Takes a <tt>double</tt> as input and returns nothing.  Sets the minimum value for the contract.</li>
<li><tt>getMaxValue</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>double</tt>. Gets the maximum value of the contract.</li>
<li><tt>setMaxValue</tt><br /> Takes a <tt>double</tt> as input and returns nothing. Sets the maximum value for the contract.</li>
<li><tt>getBonus</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>double</tt>. Gets the per-day bonus associated with the contract.</li>
<li><tt>setBonus</tt><br /> Takes a <tt>double</tt> as input and returns nothing. Sets the per-day bonus associated with the contract.</li>
<li><tt>getPenalty</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>double</tt>. Gets the per-day penalty associated with the contract.</li>
<li><tt>setPenalty</tt><br /> Takes a <tt>double</tt> as input and returns nothing. Sets the per-day penalty associated with the contract.</li>
<li><tt>getDeadline</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>Date</tt>. Gets the deadline for the contract.</li>
<li><tt>setDeadline</tt><br /> Takes a <tt>Date</tt> as input and returns nothing. Sets the deadline for the contract.</li>
<li><tt>equals</tt><br /> you are to <em>override</em> the <tt>equals</tt> method inherited from <tt>Object</tt> so that
this Contract is equal to the input object if that object is a <tt>Contract</tt> with the same ID as this contract.</li>
<li><tt>isAcceptingBids</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>boolean</tt>. Returns <tt>true</tt> if a contractor may submit a bid for the contract.</li>
<li><tt>getBestBid</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>Bid</tt>. Returns the best bid so far for the contract.  May return <tt>null</tt> if there have been no acceptable bids.</li>
<li><tt>makeBid</tt><br /> Takes a <tt>Bid</tt> as input and returns a <tt>boolean</tt>.  Processes a bid.  The method returns <tt>true</tt> if this bid is accepted and becomes the current best bid.  The method
returns <tt>false</tt> if the bid is not accepted.  For a bid to be accepted, the contract must be accepting bids and the bid's contract must equal this contract.  Also, the value of the bid must be between (or equal to)
the minimum and maximum value for the contract, and the value must be smaller than the current best bid (if there exists a current best bid).</li>
<li><tt>awardContract</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns nothing  The contract is no longer accepting bids.</li>
<li><tt>isComplete</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>boolean</tt>. Returns <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> depending on whether the contract has been completed.</li>
<li><tt>completeDate</tt><br /> Takes no input and returns a <tt>Date</tt>. Returns the date that the contract was completed.  Will return <tt>null</tt> if the contract was not completed.</li>
<li><tt>setComplete</tt> Takes a <tt>Date</tt> as input and returns nothing. Sets the contract to <em>completed</em>, sets the completed date for the contract to the input value, and pays the contractor of the best bid
the required amount by calling the <tt>pay</tt> method of the appropriate Contractor instance.  The amount paid should be equal to the value of the best bid plus or minus
any bonus or penalty.  The bonus and penalty is computed by multiplying the contract bonus or penalty amount by the number of days the contract is completed before or after the 
deadline. However, the amount paid should not exceed the maximum value of the contract nor should the amount paid be negative (though it can otherwise be smaller than the minimum value of the contract).</li>
</ol><p></p>
The Contract class should have the following constructor:
<ol type = "a">
<li>The constructor takes a <em>contract id</em>, a <em>minimum value</em>, a <em>maximim value</em>, a <em>bonus amount</em>,
a <em>penalty amount</em>, and a <em>deadline</em> and initializes the Contract instances appropriately.
</li>
</ol>
</p></li>

<li><p>The GovernmentContract class.<br />  The GovernmentContract class is a contract by a government entity.  The government contract
has the same behavior as a Contract <em>except</em> that the <tt>makeBid</tt> method should return <tt>true</tt> and
accept the bid if all the
conditions listed above in Contract's <tt>makeBid</tt> method hold <em>and</em>
if the Contractor on the bid is a GovernmentContractor.  If the Contractor is not a GovernmentContractor, or if the conditions
listed above in Contract's <tt>makeBid</tt> method do not hold, then the method should return <tt>false</tt> and the bid is not accepted. </p>
</li>
</ol>
